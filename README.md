# Learning Underscore.js

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Tutorial: <https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-underscore-js/>

A few commands I used to got started:

```bash
npm init
npm install underscore
```

If you clone my repo, you'll just need to run this command ***inside*** the folder:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```
